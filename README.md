Just finished Screamboat and OMG I can't even. First off, it felt like they were trying waaay too hard to be edgy, you know what I mean? Like, the plot was just everywhere, all over the place. It's like they threw a bunch of horror clichés in a blender and poured it onto the screen. It was something, I'll give them that 😂.

> Seriously though, there’s something tragically hilarious about a villain whose greatest weapon is a... rubber chicken? I mean, I thought I'd seen everything, but nope, Screamboat proved me wrong. Just goes to show there's no bottom to the creative well of ridiculousness. And that boat setting... they kinda missed the mark a bit. Like, were they trying to be Titanic but make it spooky? 🤷‍♀️ 

Kinda makes me think if you just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for kicks, it's worth a one-time laugh, just for the absurdity. At least the music slapped though, like some of those tracks could genuinely haunt my dreams. But really, if you want a real horror experience, maybe save it for 𝘕𝘦𝘵𝘧𝘭𝘪𝘹’ suggestions. 

And the acting? Stick figures show more emotion. Sorry not sorry. Emotions bounced like they were on pogo sticks, no depth, just bam, flatlines and then a sudden scream. Somehow I felt more exhausted 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 them pretend to be scared than if they were actually being chased. But hey, you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   yourself and let me know if you find anything worth it.

```python
random_variable = What's this doing here?
```

Anyway, now I gotta unwind. Maybe a long nap or a cup of tea could cleanse my palate from this wacky boat trip. Let's catch up soon, I need someone to laugh this off with 😂
